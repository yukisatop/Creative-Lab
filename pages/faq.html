                    Absolutely not. Children learn a lot about what it means to be
                    respectful and polite here. As a result, kids who weren't violent
                    in the first place become even more respectful and kind. Kids with
                    behavior problems often become very respectful an calm.

                <p class="answer">
                    Yes! After all, these are children we're dealing with here. And
                    kids love their fun. We do a variety of games and activities that

                    are ahead of them. It builds a sense of confidence, pride, and teamwork.

                    We have classes for kids as young as 3, and as old as teenagers. Martial
                    arts is the kind of thing that grows with you. So as kids get older,
                    they learn new techniques, perfect old ones, and advance. When they're
                    younger, it's more about fun and games, with learning thrown in too.

                <p class="answer">
                    Martial arts are for boys and girls. Our classes have a good mix
                    of both, too. So if you're worried about your girl being alone
                    in a group of boys, wipe that worry from your mind!
